Click here to visit the week 4 version, and make a submission there.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/covid19-global-forecasting-week-4)**\n\n*This is week 3 of Kaggle\u0027s COVID19 forecasting series, following the [Week 2 competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/covid19-global-forecasting-week-2). This is the 3rd of at least 4 competitions we plan to launch in this series. All of the prior discussion forums have been migrated to this competition for continuity.*\n\n### Background\n\nThe White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) pulled together a coalition research groups and companies (including Kaggle)  to prepare the [COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19)](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge) to attempt to address [key open scientific questions on COVID-19](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks). Those questions are drawn from [National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s (NASEM)](https://www.nationalacademies.org/event/03-11-2020/standing-committee-on-emerging-infectious-diseases-and-21st-century-health-threats-virtual-meeting-1) and the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/key-action/Global_Research_Forum_FINAL_VERSION_for_web_14_feb_2020.pdf?ua=1).\n\n### The Challenge\n\nKaggle is launching a companion COVID-19 forecasting challenges to help answer a [subset of the NASEM/WHO questions](https://www.kaggle.com/c/covid19-global-forecasting-week-3/overview/open-scientific-questions). While the challenge involves forecasting confirmed cases and fatalities between April 1 and April 30 by region, the primary goal **isn\u0027t only to produce accurate forecasts**. It’s also to identify factors that appear to impact the transmission rate of COVID-19.\n\nYou are encouraged to pull in, curate and share data sources that might be helpful. If you find variables that look like they impact the transmission rate, please share your finding in a notebook. \n\nAs the data becomes available, we will update the leaderboard with live results based on [data made available](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series) from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE).\n\nWe have received support and guidance from health and policy organizations in launching these challenges. We\u0027re hopeful the Kaggle community can make valuable contributions to developing a better understanding of factors that impact the transmission of COVID-19. \n\n### Companies and Organizations\n\n**There is also a call to action for companies and other organizations:** If you have datasets that might be useful, please upload them to [Kaggle’s dataset platform](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and reference them in [this forum thread](https://www.kaggle.com/c/covid19-global-forecasting-week-3/discussion/137078). That will make them accessible to those participating in this challenge and a resource to the wider scientific community.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nJHU CSSE for making the data available to the public. The White House OSTP for pulling together the key open questions. The image comes from the Center for Disease Control.\n\n\u003e **This is a Code Competition.

This is the 3rd of at least 4 competitions we plan to launch in this series. All of the prior discussion forums have been migrated to this competition for continuity.*\n\n### Background\n\nThe White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) pulled together a coalition research groups and companies (including Kaggle)  to prepare the [COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19)](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge) to attempt to address [key open scientific questions on COVID-19](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks). Those questions are drawn from [National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s (NASEM)](https://www.nationalacademies.org/event/03-11-2020/standing-committee-on-emerging-infectious-diseases-and-21st-century-health-threats-virtual-meeting-1) and the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/key-action/Global_Research_Forum_FINAL_VERSION_for_web_14_feb_2020.pdf?ua=1).\n\n### The Challenge\n\nKaggle is launching a companion COVID-19 forecasting challenges to help answer a [subset of the NASEM/WHO questions](https://www.kaggle.com/c/covid19-global-forecasting-week-3/overview/open-scientific-questions). While the challenge involves forecasting confirmed cases and fatalities between April 1 and April 30 by region, the primary goal **isn\u0027t only to produce accurate forecasts**. It’s also to identify factors that appear to impact the transmission rate of COVID-19.\n\nYou are encouraged to pull in, curate and share data sources that might be helpful. If you find variables that look like they impact the transmission rate, please share your finding in a notebook. \n\nAs the data becomes available, we will update the leaderboard with live results based on [data made available](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series) from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE).\n\nWe have received support and guidance from health and policy organizations in launching these challenges. We\u0027re hopeful the Kaggle community can make valuable contributions to developing a better understanding of factors that impact the transmission of COVID-19. \n\n### Companies and Organizations\n\n**There is also a call to action for companies and other organizations:** If you have datasets that might be useful, please upload them to [Kaggle’s dataset platform](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and reference them in [this forum thread](https://www.kaggle.com/c/covid19-global-forecasting-week-3/discussion/137078). That will make them accessible to those participating in this challenge and a resource to the wider scientific community.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nJHU CSSE for making the data available to the public.

Our goal is to provide better methods for estimates that can assist medical and governmental institutions to prepare and adjust as pandemics unfold*.\n\n## Files\n - `train.csv` - the training data (you are encouraged to join in many more useful external datasets)\n - `test.csv` - the dates to predict; there is a week of overlap with the training data for the initial Public leaderboard. Once submissions are paused, the Public leaderboard will update based on last 28 days of predicted data.\n - `submission.csv` - a sample submission in the correct format; again, predictions should be *cumulative*\n\n## Data Source\n - This evaluation data for this competition comes from **[John Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series)**, which is uninvolved in the competition. \n -
